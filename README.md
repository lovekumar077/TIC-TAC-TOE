## Overview

This project is a web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game where two players can play against each other. The game is built using HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the game logic.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive user interface
- Two-player mode
- Highlighting the winning combination
- Responsive design, playable on different screen sizes
